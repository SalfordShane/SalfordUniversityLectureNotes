### Introduction to WDHCI (Stefan Pletschacher)

_2020-09-28 12:00:00 - 2020-09-28 12:50:00_

In Dr Pletschacher's lectures, the chat will be disabled and students are expected to "put their hand up" if they want to ask a question using their microphone.

WDHCI is an acronym for Wed Development & Human/Computer Interaction.

The WDHCI lectures will not be recorded for later viewing, attendance is mandatory. This is because Dr Pletschacher is concerned about copyright and the elgality of recording sessions without getting permission from each individual student.

#### WDHCI Structure

The first module of WDHCI will cover HTML, CSS and the basics of the internet and transport protocols. Web media (and web page production) and web accessibility will also be covered.

Other modules will cover: Server side programming (PHP, ASP, PErl, etc), client side programming (Javascript and dynamic features), Databvases, Frameworks and Web services.

#### Assessment

Students will be assessed according to the following methodology:

* Designing, developing and testing a website: 50% of the overall mark
* A second assignment in the second semester: 50% of the overall mark 

#### Web Development

Web development was originally about delivering static pages. Modern web development is much more complex and sophisticated, with applications for virtual assistants, machine learning and image recognition.

WWW is an acronym for "World wide web", the world wide web is an application which runs on top of the internet. The internet is a communication channel designed to send "hypertext" / "hypermedia". Hypertext is "text with links in it", hypermedia is an expansion of this idea, it's "text with images, videos and dynamic features".

The internet is the physical infrastructure (networks, cables, computers) and on top of that several applications run (WWW, video streaming, banking, etc)

#### History of the web

The first web page was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research).

Originally, the internet was predominantly static web pages. Dynamic web pages (like news portals and forums) were built next. Modern day applications have "rich content", features which traditionally could only be added to "native applications" but as the internet has matured more complex features have become possible.

There are negatives to modern cloud applications as they can be upgraded (or downgraded) without your permission which contrasts with native, installed applications which you can own forever (unless you're using something with a subscription like Adobe Creative Cloud)

#### Basics of the internet

HTTP is a protocol (it specifies what a client can ask from a server, and what a server can respond to that client with. HTTP is an acronym for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol".

In your browser you can enter a URL (a uniform resource locator) in the address bar and click "go" and a "GET" request is made. The GET requests asks the server for information about that URL and the server will respond with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML is a specification (a set of rules) about how to write something in a text file so that the browser knows how to display the web page correctly.

Some example HTML "values" (or tags) are:

* Titles
* Links
* Paragraphs
* Images

A url with the format `http://dev.example.com:80/gallery/videos?id=21#comments` contains the following parts:

```
http://     dev.example.com:80     /gallery/videos    ?id=21     #comments
{Scheme}    {Net location}         {Path}             {Query}    {Fragment}
```

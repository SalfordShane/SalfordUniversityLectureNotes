Dr Pletschacher said that we will receive information about the module assignment tomorrow. Students will be asked to build a website which follows best practices. Students can make the topic of the website whatever they want: Puppies, Ecommerce, pictures of Fungi, etc. Students should not contact dr Pletschacher to talk about their ideas.

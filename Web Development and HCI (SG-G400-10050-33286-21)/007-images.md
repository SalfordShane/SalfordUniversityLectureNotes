#### HTML Images

There are a number of considerations when selecting images to display on a webpage:

* What the size of the image should be
* What file format you should use (png, jpeg, gif, webm, etc)
* If we are legally allowed to use the image (copyright concerns)

Choosing the correct image is important:

* The image should be relevant to the content
* The image should convey information or be stylistically pleasing
* The image should fit the colour pallete of the website

Students who use images which aren't in the public domain without permission for their final project will lose marks.

#### Image tags

The image tag `<img />` has three parts:

```html
<img      src="https://i.imgur.com/EATqC3a.jpeg"       alt="A porcelian fox"                 title="By L. Smorgon" />
{tag}     {the source, or URL of the image}            {alternative text for screen readers} {extra information}
```

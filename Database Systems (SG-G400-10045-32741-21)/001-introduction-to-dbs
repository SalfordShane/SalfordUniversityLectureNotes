#### Surgeries

Dr Bryant hosts "surgeries" (contact hours) during the teaching portions of the semester. He will be available via Microsoft Teams and the times are subject to change. It is a drop in service which does **not** require an appointment.

#### Assessments

* Semester 1 will be assessed via coursework (50% of the total year)  
* Semester 2 will be assessed via coursework (50% of the total year) - normally, this would be an exam but the exam has been cancelled due to COVID.
* The overall passing grade is 40%

#### Required Reading

It is recommended that students read the Preface and Chapters 1, 2 of the exercise booklet as soon as possible before teaching begins in earnest.

#### Database systems

The module will cover:

* File based database systems (their characteristics and limitations)  
* Database Management Systems (typical functions, advantages and disadvantages)  
* Relational Databases (Primary and Foreign Keys)

#### Limitations of the file based approach

One of the major drawbacks of classical file based databases was incompatibility. Each application had its own file format and this made interoparability close to impossible.

Another drawback was duplication of data: each server needs to have its own copy of the file based database. This requires additional (Expensive) storage space and can lead to a loss of data integrity if there aren't timely backups.

#### Database Systems

Database systems are characteristed by: 

* A collection of data (the database)  
* A piece of software which enables access to the database (a database management system (DBMS))  
* A user (or group of users) who load data from the database

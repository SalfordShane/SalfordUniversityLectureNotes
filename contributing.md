Notes should be in the following format:

```
### Title of the lecture (Name of the staff member giving the lecture)

_Start date including time - end date including time_

Body of the lecture notes in markdown format
```

Start dates should be given in the format 2020-09-15 00:00:00, for those familiar with PHP's date format string it's (Y-m-d h:i:s).

Notes should be factual, informative and include generally correct grammar and spelling. Particularly poor submissions may be asked to submit changes to the pull request.

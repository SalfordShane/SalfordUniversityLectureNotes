Individuals need their personal data to be protected so that:

* The data remains accurate and up to date
* The data is not used in a way which is not allowed
* The data is not accessed by unauthorised people

When users sign up to websites, those websites capture and store personal data of the users. The Data Protection Act is designed to ensure that data is safeguarded.

#### Key Legislation

* UK Data Protection Act 2018
* EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* Article 8 on the European Convention on Human Rights

#### GDPR

GDPR is a European Regulation designed to protect the data of European citizens and companies. Violations of data protection under GDPR carry heavy fines for infringement.

GDPR applies in the following circumstances:

* The data is being processed by a European organisation  
* _or_: The data is being processed on equipment based in the EU

Breaches of GDPR carries very large fines (up to 4% of the national turnover of companies).

#### Data Controller

The Data controller is the person (or people) who determine why or how personal data will be processed. They are responsible for ensuring that all processing of personal information complies with the relevant laws.

#### Data Processor

Processing data is a complex term for a simple idea: Processing data just means collecting, changing and transferring personal data.

The data processor is the person (or people) who actually process data on behalf of the data controller.

#### Data collection

Users must give explicit consent for the collection of personal data. Consent can not be implied, it requires informed and active consent (the user understanding what is happening and accepting the data collection).

Users must be able to review, edit and delete their personal data from your systems.

Users must be prompted regularly to confirm the accuracy of their data.

You must delete the user's data when it is no longer relevant for processing purposes. You can not keep personal data indefinitely.

Data must be stored securely: secure against hacking, secured against employees accessing it without authorisation, etc.

#### Anonymisation

Anonymising data means removing the personal information from data. If the data doesn#t contain names or other information which allows you to identify an individual, it can be used in a wider range of processing applications without permission.

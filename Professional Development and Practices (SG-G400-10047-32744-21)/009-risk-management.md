#### Budgeting

Every project needs a budget. Projects almost never have an unlimited amount of money to spend and it's important that we are able to account for all the money spent. A lot of the time you have to know what you're going to be spending and when you're going to be spending it to be able to get funding from your financial backers.

Scheduling and budgeting are important because they show you the `runway` or available time and money you have left. Running out of runway can cause a project (or company) to be cancelled. One example where reducing expenses has helped to save a project is companies allowing people to work from home and cancelling their office rent during COVID to save money.

#### How to budget

* Begin by writing down all the expenses
* Categorise the expenses (salaries, overheads, equipment, etc)
* Break down your budget in to sensible time periods (monthly, weekly, quarterly, etc)

This will show you how much you need to spend in total and when you need to spend it by. This will give you a view in to whether you need more money or if you need to change the schedule by which you receive money.

#### What is a risk?

Risk it something which _might_ happen, and if it _does_ it will cause problems for the project. If there is zero chance of a risk occurring, it is not a risk and you don't need to worry about it.

There are 10 rules of risk management:

* Make risk management part of your project planning
* Identify risk early instead of reactively
* Talk about risks
* Consider both threats _and_ opportunities
* Make sure risks are owned by specific people
* Analyse risks
* Prioritise risks
* Plan and implement your responses to risks
* Register project risks somewhere people can see it
* Track risks and the tasks associated with them as they occur

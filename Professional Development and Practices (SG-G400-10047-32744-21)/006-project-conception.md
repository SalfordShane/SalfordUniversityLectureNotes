#### Project failure

Many projects have none technical reasons for their failure:

* Scope creep (constantly changing business goals which effect the project)
* Lack of support or buy-in from the executive (management team)
* Over-complexity or over-specification
* Lack of budget

Unsuccessful projects:

* Don't worry about stakeholders, budgets or targets
* Don't include technical and business experts
* Don't create a well structured, focussed team
* Fail to core project maangement practices (unclear objectives, unknown responsibilities, poor change and release management, no performance monitoring)

#### How should a project be initiated?

* Plan all the steps you need follow ahead of time, think carefully about what needs to be done
* Create a business plan, think about funding, monetisation, costs, timescales, who your customers are

To start off with consider the requirements of the project:

* What do we need to complete the project?
* What already exists? What needs to be created?
* What is to be delivered and by when?
* Consider the costs of each component, what are the benefits and how long do those benefits take to manifest?

#### Pricing a project

How much you're going to charge (or if you charge at all) for your project is important. You need to be able to (at least) cover your costs and this means that some projects simple aren't viable: they will never recover the costs spent to develop them.

Are there on-going costs (It infrastructure, salaries)? Is your product a one-off deliverable or delivered over a period of several months or years? These are important considerations when deciding if you should charge per project, per day or as a subscription model.

#### Work breakdown structure

A WBS is a hierarchical tree of all the tasks needed to complete a project:

* Level 0 (the project itself)
* Level 1 (Main bodies of work)
* Level 2 (tasks within each body of work)
* Level 3 (Sub-tasks, etc.)

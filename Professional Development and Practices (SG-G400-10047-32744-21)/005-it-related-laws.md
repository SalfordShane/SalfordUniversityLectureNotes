Over the last 40 years computers and the internet have massively increased the scope with which IT effects our every day lives. A lot of laws and practices have had to be created across the world to adapt to the impact IT can have on our lives and protect us from nefarious people and companies.

#### Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act

RIPA is legislation which gives several public bodies the right to intercept communication (emails, phone calls, posted letters, etc). Some of the bodies which have the right to make `requests to hand over information` are:

* GCHQ
* The police
* The ambulance service
* The postal service commissioner

RIPA has 5 key parts:

* Acquisition and disclosure: Being able to get warrants and surveillance to intercept data  
* Use of communications data  
* Directed surveillance: being able to follow people
* Covert human intelligence: Undercover officers
* Intrusive surveillance: Placing electronic bugs in people's homes, offices and vehicles

#### Law enforcement access to data

The Data protection act contains exceptions where a crime has committed or is suspected to have been comitted. This exception allows disclosure of private information to the courts or investigatory bodies as long as the disclosure is "fair", "limited" and only used for "the purposes it was collected for".

#### Computer misuse act

The computer misuse act seeks to prevent the unathorised access, usage, modifications and criminalisation of computers. Offences are committed under the CMA if the person OR the computer being attacked is location within the UK at the time of the misuse.

Even if you don't do anything on the computer, simply the action of breaking in to or using a computer without authorisation is against the law.

If you do any of the following you are breaking the law:

* Causing unauthorised modification of the content of a computer  
* Intending to impair the operation of a computer  
* Preventing or hindering access to a program or data held in a computer  
* Impair the operation of a program or the reliability of data

#### Electronic Commerce Regulations Act

The ECRA effects you whether you are buying online or in person and regulates the following:

* Transactions made and conducted through any electronic means (from smart watches to digital televisions)
* All quoted prices must be clear, unambiguous and include the currency and tax
* The organisations name and address must be clearly displayed (and correct!)
* How legally binding contracts are formed when a purchase is made
* How advertising and commercial communications must be conducted

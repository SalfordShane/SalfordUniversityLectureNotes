### Professionalism (Nigel Linge)

The word professional is often used as a byword for "quality". There is a "professional approach", you buy a "professional product", it is "used by professionals".

Professionals should be skilled, competent and worthy of trust.

Part of attending university to become a professional is properly engaging with the course, attending, working hard and interacting with the staff at university. Ultimately, the person who leaves university will be a product of the work that person puts in to their studies.

If you're given 6 weeks to perform an assignment it's important to actually spend that time doing work instead of rushing at the last minute. The time and thought put in to your assignments will be reflected in the end result and ultimately the grades you attain.

#### Professional recognition

Graduating with a degree is one way to be recognised as a professional. Another way is joining or being accredited to a professional institute (like the British Computer Society).

The BCS says that: "Students should not perceive legal, social, ethical and professional issues as peripheral to, or less significant than, technical skills detailed in the syllabus.

Which means: "Your knowledge of the issues surrounding your profession are just as important as your skill in that profession. Being able to write beautiful code isn't enough if you can't operate within the boundaries set for you."

#### Standards of behaviour

Consider:

* The quality of your work
* How you interact with others (not just your peers, but everyone, customers, suppliers, colleagues, managers, people at other organisations)
* Are you adhering to the law?
* Are you maintaining your abilities over time?
* Is your performance consistent?

The BCS defines professional behaviour in their code of conduct as:

* Respect (Public interest)
* Responsibility and integrity (Competency)  
* Quality (Duty to the profession)
* Commitment to your profession (Duty to relevant authorities)

#### The law

Everyone has to comply with the laws of the land. For IT professionals that means being aware of GDPR and other cookie laws, copyright and intellectual property law.

Everyone has to follow the law and by a set of quality assurance procedures to be successful in their career. 

#### Quality assurance

The BCS defines quality systems and standards for software engineers.

Organisations (employers) put their own standards in place to comply with those standards. To ensure the suitability of the standards the organisation must take part in "quality audits". A report is generated (either internally via self-audit or by an external body) and compared to the BCS standards. If the organisation meets or exceeds the standards they are "approved".

#### Quality systems in practice

When a car is being built there are several points at which the car goes through quality assurance:

* When each individual component has been manufactured  
* When the car has been assembled from the components  
* Before it is sold to a customer  
* When it receives an MOT after three years

#### Quality at Salford

The university has the following quality systems in place:

* External examiners
* Professiaonl standards from the British Computing Society
* Audits from Ofstead
* The Quality Assurance Agency carry out audits every 5 years
* Visits and reports from the Office of Students

#### ISO-9000

ISO-9000 is a set of standards which reprsent good "quality management practices"

It lays out the requirements for the levels your qualitysystem must meet and grants a certification upon completion which allows companies to advertise that they meet ISO-9000 standards. It is a good "green flag" when working with an organisation to know that they are a professional company which cares about the quality of its work.

#### Continuous improvement

It's important for organisations to continuously improve their compliance with standards and the quality of their work. This continuous improvement is an introspection: looking at previous performance, learning from mistakes (and successes) and feeding this information back in to the processes your organisation has in place.

It's important to `design for zero defects`, that is, put in place processes to find faults and ensure they are learned from so that they never happen again.

#### The Law

The law is just a set of rules and standards which are enforced by courts and have penalties for failing.

Law is created in the UK through the following steps:

* The government creates a document called a green paper  
* After consulting with experts and members of the public the document is amended as a "white paper"
* The white paper is debated by members of parliament
* If approved it moves on to the House of Lords
* The queen gives "royal assent" and the document becomes an "act of parliament" or a law

In Dr Linge's lectures, students should "put their hands up" in Blackboard instead of typing in the chat to get the lecturers attention. All lectures will be recorded for people who miss the live lectures.

#### Professional Development and Practices

This course teaches students soft skills which enable future employees to operate within a professional environment.

Professionalism is a two-way street, if you expect companies and others to treat you with respect then you have to treat them with respect. PDP creates a framework within which people can work efficiently and without conflict.

The implication is that customers suffer when software is created in an unprofessional, uncontrolled environment which can cause significant losses to companies and the public sector. The public transportation system in Manchester suffers from major failures as a result of improperly built IT systems.

Perception matters: the media's portrayal of computer systems as being buggy reflects poorly on the profession. Professionalism applied over a long period of time can have an impact in reducing or reversing this perception.

PDP is required because the BCS (British Computer Society) require a PDP module for the degree to be accredited.

The module will cover two main topics:

* Professionalism (Quality systems, the law, social media, ethics, professional bodies)  
* Project Management (Project planning, project execution, project monitoring and team work)

#### Assessment

The module will be assessed via a mixture of assignments (there are currently no PDP exams because of COVID). These assignments are both personal and group projects.

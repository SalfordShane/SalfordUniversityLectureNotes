### Introduction to Programming (David Newton)

_2020-09-28 09:00:00 - 2020-09-28 09:50:00_

In Dr Newton's lectures, students should post questions in the chat instead of "putting their hand up" in Blackboard as it requires him to enable microphones for everyone.

#### Timetables

Group timetables lessons (lectures and tutorials) last 50 minutes. Within the group timetables the following acronyms are used:

* CC: Computer Science Suite (as weird as that is)
* Prog 1: Programming 1  
* PDP: Professional Development Practices  
* WDHCI: Web Development and Human / Computer interfaces
* CSIL: Computer system Internals and Linux  

Items in red in the timetable require in-person attendance at the university.

'Central drop-in' sessions are optional sessions where students can spend time with lecturers (it's more likely to be a couple of final year students than lecturers) outside of timetabled lectures to ask questions about any of the ongoing (or previous) modules. Drop-in sessions will be organised via email so it's important that students frequently check emails.

#### Tutorials

All the laboratories will be located in the Newton building on the main campus.

PCs are provided for students (though students can choose to bring in a laptop if they want to). All input devices (keyboards, mouses, monitors, etc.) will be cleaned up to 30 minutes before each tutorial. When students arrive, they should clean the keyboard, mouse and monitor again with the provided cleaning equipment.

#### Programming 1

The course is "object-first" so the lectures and tutorials will focus on object oriented programming from the very beginning.

The minimum passing grade is 40%. The course will be continuously assessed. 75% of the module's marking is based on 4/5 programming exercises, the remaining 25% is based on 2 written tests which last 1 hour each. Individual solutions are required for any programming exercises, sharing of code is considered plagiarism. "Specimin" questions will be given in the 2 weeks running up to each exam which will be similar to the upcoming exam - this allows students to understand what will be expected of them on the exams.

Students are _heavily_ advised to purchase the following book: Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction using BlueJ (sixth edition) by Barnes and Kolling.

All lectures and tutorials are mandatory, simply reading the required text will not be sufficient to pass the course. Extra (supplementary) worksheets will be provided for each chapter of material in the Objects First book.

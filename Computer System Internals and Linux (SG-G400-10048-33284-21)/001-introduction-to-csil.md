### Introduction to CSIL (Norman Murray)

_2020-09-29 10:00:00 - 2020-09-29 10:50:00_

#### Assessment

5 tests, each equaling 10% of the final mark

Tests will be: Weeks 4, 8 and 12, semester two will have 2 "final tests"

#### Linux

Linux is all around us. Our phones, our fridges, our smart devices, almost every piece of none-PC/laptop technology runs Linux in some form.

Workshops on Linux will focus on command line Linux, in the following aras:

* Editing, moving, copying, renaming, sorting, extracting files  
* The history of the command line, pipes, redirection  
* Regular expressions (grep and sed)  
* Scripting languages  
* Sytem administration

In the first workshop:

* Students will log on to linux  
* Students will see the GUI  
* Students will get to use the command line  
* Students will manipulate files and directories

VirtualBox allows you to run other operating systems on top of your base operating system (like running Ubuntu on top of your Windows computer). VirtualBox is free and easy to use.

There are instructions in Blackboard for installing VirtualBox and Ubuntu. You can also Dual boot your computer - harder to do - if you know what you are doing but this won't be supported by the staff.

#### Computer System Internals

Lectures and tutorials in the first 4 weeks will focus on:

* Binary arithmetic
* Octal/Hexadecimal
* Floating point numbers
* Boolean Logic

The following 8 weeks focus on:

* Data communication (flow control, terminology, security, networks, bandwidth, encoding, pulse code modulation)

The final 8 weeks will focus on:

* Operating systems (memory management, processes, file systems, security, virtual memory, swapping, multitasking, fragmentation)

#### Binary

Binary is "base 2", Decimal is "base 10". Almost all the numbers we interact with on a daily basis are base 10. IF you're reading this part of the notes, I suggest you look up bases on wikipedia: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(mathematics)#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20base%20or,digits%20from%200%20to%209.

Computers use Binary systems because they store data as elictrical current (is there a current? it's 1, is there no current? it's 0)

Examples:

```
Convert 5 to binary by seeing what you can substract from 5:

128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1
0     0    0    0    0   1   0   1

Convert 153 to binary by seeing what you can substract from 153:

128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1
1     0    0    1    1   0   0   1
```

#### Command line interfaces

The CLI (Command line interface) makes boring and repetitive tasks much easier. It allows you to write a program once and run it hundreds of times, for instance, importing or creating users on a computer, which would otherwise take much longer.

The CLI is the primary (often only) way of interacting with servers and routers.

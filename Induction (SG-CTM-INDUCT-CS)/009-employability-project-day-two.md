Employability Project Day Two (Robert Hegarty, Laura Milne)

_2020-09-23 11:00:00 - 2020-09-23 11:20:00_

Students had to re-assemble in to the same groups as yesterday's session (2020-09-22).

Students were asked to discuss the skills which make a good Computer Scientist and to decide upon 6 skills for each person. Students were provided with an example radar graph in an xlsx file and had to duplicate the radar graph for each student in the group.

In the afternoon session, tutors joined each group chat to discuss the work completed before students were sent back in to the main room for a class-wide discussion.

At the end of the sessions students asked for recommendations on system specs:

* Students can use the machines in the labs, however it is beneficial to have your own computer  
* A laptop is generally going to be more portable than a desktop PC  
* A minimum of 8GB of RAM and aim for 16GB  
* Get a solid state drive instead of a hard drive  
* Operating systems are irrelevant  

Dr Hegarty also made some comments on the behaviour of students so far: The university is a professional environment and some of the language students have used thus far in the group chats have been decidedly unprofessional.

The task will be three days long and focusses on employability within a Computer Science career path. The first task will be reviewed and then students will be split up in to groups. Students will remain in the same groups for the entirety of the task.

To begin, groups should hold a round robin group discussion about the experiences of each group member in computer science, their aspirations and the career they envision. This discussion should be documented in a collaborative document. Students should also document ideas for two collaborative projects.

Students were given a proforma (an example document) to fill out and share with each other - and later, the tutors.

Employability Project Day Three (Robert Hegarty, Laura Milne)

_2020-09-24 11:00:00 - 2020-09-24 11:20:00_

There is a student recruitment open evening on Tuesday 29th September (2020-09-29) hosted by the Cyber Resilience Centre. They are looking to recruit skills with technical abilities for paid work experience.

Students were asked to find suitable jobs on Monster, etc, which they could potentially apply for after their degree. Students were asked to reflect on the skills required for these jobs and to create a skills matrix mapping their current abilities to where they need to get to.

Students were asked to map the skills they decide upon to the modules they will be taking on their course.

Students were then asked to reflect on whether their course was the correct course for their chosen career goals and the skills they wanted to develop. If students decided their course wasn't suitable they were asked to discuss this with their personal tutor.

Dr Hegarty is the main point of contact for the Ethical Hacking society.

The society has the goal of bringing together everyone across the computer science disciplines (not just cyber security) and sets at the mid-point between the maker space community and the cyber security community.

The society promotes both academic and casual research such as creating whitepapers, investigating new software and vulnerability detection for other organisations.

For students the society is an opportunity to embelish your CV with experience as part of a well known and respected organisation.

The ethical hacking is normally split in to multiple teams which take part in different CTF (capture-the-flag) and ethical hacking competitions.

The society hosts:

* Hackathons  
* Software development challenges  
* A maker space with projects involving software or hardware development  
* Interdisciplinary research  
* Meetings and talks with organisations which interact heavily with cyber security (for example GCHQ)

* A president  
* A vice president
* Students to take part in events

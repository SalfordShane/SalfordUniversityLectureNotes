Notes are extra pieces of information designed to supplement your lecture time with information you can compress and review later.

Taking notes is a skill which can be refined through practice and usage. Every time you take notes you get better at doing it. Spend time to consider the wording of your notes and use good English (or your native language) so that your notes are legible and understandable later.

You need to be prepared to take notes, with your equipment ready at the start of the lecture. If you start taking notes halfway through the lecture your notes won't have the context you will need to understand the content later.

Taking notes can be boring, but having to re-take an entire year is much more boring.

Lecture notes aren't about writing what the lecturer says, it's about reframing their words in to ideas which you can understand. If you write everything the lecturer says your notes will be too long and contain too much unnecessary information.

Physical notes will do the job, but electronic notes are searchable. Store your notes in a text only format like markdown or txt so that you can search your notes without opening the files.

Read the slide handouts before the lecture begins so that you have questions ready or know where you need to focus heavily during the lecture.

Arrive 10 minutes early and plan what you're going to do during the lecture. This gives you time for accidents like missing a bus but also means that you're ready when the lecture begins. Have your pens / laptop ready before the lecture begins.

Have your phone on silent so that it doesn't disrupt the other students and draw attention to yourself. I can't believe I'm writing this, but: don't answer your phone during a lecture.

Highlight or underline key points which you found formative in your understand of the subject.

Ask questions if you're unsure, questions aren't stupid, you aren't stupid, you're just improving your knowledge when everyone else is too afraid to ask.

Listen for audio cues from the speaker, did they suddenly speak more slowly or loudly? They _need_ you to understand this material. **If the lecturer says "take notes on this", they _REALLY_ need you to udnerstand this material**.

After lectures, quickly revising and re-writing notes is very time effective. Leaving the revision for weeks will mean you have to relearn the fundamentals before you can study.

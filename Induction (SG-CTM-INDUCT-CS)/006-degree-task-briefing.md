The tutor divided the students in to 6 groups and showed each group a video containing a riddle and asked the students to answer the riddles.

The first riddle was related to people crossing briudges and amounted to an optimisation problem which involved utilising the fastest people and combining the slowest people.

The second riddle was related to imperfect information and binary searches, involving a group of 10 people trying to figure out which colour hat they have on their head.

The third riddle was related to graph theory and involved 15 contaminated rooms (and a non-contaminated entrance) containing viruses.

The fourth riddle was related to angles and multi-part solutions and involved planes flying around the earth and having to refuel each other.
